# Canteen-Viewer

NTUâ€™s north spine canteen is a popular choice for students to have a quick meal in between breaks during school. In order to enhance the experience of individuals willing to dine in the canteen, we have created a real-time canteen information system. With this application, users will be allowed to browse through the stalls open in the north spine canteen and their current menu at any date and time. It also helps to determine the waiting time for each stall to help the user make informed decisions.  
  
Designed using Python 3.8 and Tkinter, this program makes use of a dynamic program involving two files, strings, dictionaries, lists and tuples. The dynamic program enables changes made in the database to be reflected immediately in the application.
